Absolutely! Here’s a clean and professional README.md for your MiniRedis project based on everything we’ve built so far:

# 🧠 MiniRedis — Your Own In-Memory Key-Value Store in Go

MiniRedis is a lightweight, Redis-like key-value store built in Go.
It supports basic Redis commands like `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, and advanced features like hashes (`HSET`, `HGET`, `HDEL`) and TTL expiration.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔑 `SET`, `GET`, `DEL` — Basic string storage
- 🧱 `HSET`, `HGET`, `HDEL` — Hash support (`map<string, string>`)
- ⏱️ `EX` option for TTL (time-to-live) on keys
- 🧼 Clean modular codebase for easier maintenance and extension
